# osu! bloodcat

osu! bloodcat is a Chrome extension which manipulates the osu! website to download songs by default from bloodcat.

This chrome extension is for people who do not have the osu! supporter tag. It enables any players to download songs without limits from bloodcat directly from the osu! website. It also enables downloading songs without logging in (via bloodcat).

A note for people who have the osu! supporter tag. Your downloads are not limited, and thus you should not be using this extension.
